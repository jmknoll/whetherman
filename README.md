<h3>The whetherman lets you know whether the temperature is going to drop.</h3>

<p>Get it? Whether. Weather?</p>

<p>Very funny, I know.</p>

<p>Anyway, this is one of the first rails apps I've made. I've had a lot of fun, and learned a lot, by making it. Hope you enjoy. Feel free to fork/offer comments for improvement.</p>

<p><strong>Planned Improvements</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Add temperature details to result page</li>
<li>Add support for cities, not just zip codes</li>
<li>Add clarifying page once city support is added</li>
<li>Better responsive design</li>
</ul>
